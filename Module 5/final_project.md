# Final Project Requirements

Congratulations on making it to Module 5!! It's time to put to use all of the knowledge you've gained throughout the course. We begin final projects January 24th and the science fair for projects will be Thursday February 7th.  The goal is to answer an "interesting" question (more on that below), that allows you to review the material we have covered in previous modules.  

### Topic requirements
The projects are in a domain of your choosing.  Your project does not have to answer just one question, but may try to answer multiple questions in a domain, or subsequent questions.  (Now that we know X, what's the next question that comes from this.)  When choosing a topic, try to think through the "So what?" of your question.  

* What are the outcomes you think you will find (use mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive for this), and then so what?
* How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?
* What real world outcomes does your model lead to?

Also, plan in advance for feasibility of the question in the time allowed, answering the following:

* What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?
* What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?

### Technical Requirements

Your project must meet the following technical requirements:


A. Dataset/Database
* A unique dataset, either from multiple sources or scraped
* Preferred: Use of SQL and a database

B. Processing Data
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Feature Selection
* Preferred: Create a script that can process new data

C. Modeling
* Test on at least 3 models with different hyperparameters
  * These can be any models we have covered in the course thus far

D. Evaluation of machine learning models
  * Have comparison of models with relevant performance metrics
  * Explain the tradeoffs of each each model and choose an optimal model with justification for your decision

E. Visualizations
* At least 4 meaningful visualizations

F. Final Deliverables

The deliverables for this project will be two components:

1. A 4-minute presentation in front of your data scientist peers
2. A Jupyter notebook for a presentation (this will end up being the readme on your github)
  * The Jupyter notebook will have two components:
    1. First a case to be made for actions/conclusions aimed towards a non-technical audience
    2. The technical analysis for a data science audience
3. Optional : a Flask or Dash web application

### Final Project Proposals (2 project ideas)
#### Due Monday January 28th, 2018
1. What question/questions are you trying to solve?
  * What are the outcomes you think you will find (could use mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive for this), and then so what?
  * How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?
  * What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?
  * What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?

2. What are some data sources that would allow you to answer this?
  * What is the ideal data you would hope to gather to answer this question?  
  * Potentially missing data, that could cause omitted variable bias?
3. How will you present your data? Will it be a jupyter notebook presentation or a Dashboard.
4. How will you use regression and/or classification?
5. What are the challenges you foresee with this project?
6. What are your next steps moving forward?
